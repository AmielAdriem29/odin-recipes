    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Champorado is a sweet chocolate rice porridge that uses sweet glutinous rice
        (locally known as malagkit) and cocoa powder as main ingredients. A more
        traditional approach would be using tableya (pure cocoa blocks) instead of
        cocoa powder.
    </p>

    <p>
        This porridge can be served hot or cold and is mostly eaten during breakfast.
        This can also be served during mid-afternoon snacks (meryenda) and is best when
        complimented with Tuyo (salted dried fish).
