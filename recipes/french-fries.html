            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                I like French fries but I prefer them crunchy. I tried making homemade fries
                from scratch before but it doesn’t give me the crunchiness that I am looking
                for. There are also other recipes that make use of cornstarch to help make the
                fries crispy – but I’m all good with the natural potato starch in the potatoes
                that I’ll be frying.
            </p>

            <p>
                Good thing that someone shared to me her secret on how to make crispy French
                fries a few years back and I’ve been following that style ever since. The
                technique is called “double frying”; sliced potatoes need to be fried until
                the texture becomes a little crispy then re-fried until it becomes crispier.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to save time.</li>
                <li>Slice the potatoes into long thin pieces.</li>
                <li>Soak the potatoes in ice water for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain the water and dry the potatoes using a paper towel.</li>
                <li>Deep fry the potatoes for 10 minutes or until the color turns light brown. Do not put too many potatoes in a batch as it will take more time for it to be cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove the potatoes from the deep fryer or cooking pot and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Put the fried potatoes back in the fryer and fry for another 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the fried potatoes and transfer to a plate with paper towels. Sprinkle some salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve. Share and enjoy!</li>
