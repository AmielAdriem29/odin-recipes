            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite
                among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce,
                vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s
                definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually,
                there are other renditions of adobo.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Spanish word adobar means “to marinate,” and this is actually where we got the name of
                this dish. The marinade can be in the form of a liquid one or rubbed using a combination of
                powdered ingredients. This Filipino Adobo, as I mentioned earlier, suggests marinating the
                pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. And if you would like, vinegar is something you can
                add as a marinade ingredient.
